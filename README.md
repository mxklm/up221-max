## About Me 
#### Hello! My name is Maxwell Kilman (he/his) but I go by Max. I’m a first-year in the MURP-GLM program. I was drawn to UP221, in part, as I’m fascinated by experimental cartography and other visual representations of the historical and relational processes of city-making. In particular, I’m curious to learn more about the capacity of these media to help build public knowledge, sustain cooperative systems of living, and provide new forms of data to policymakers. Anyway, that's enough about me.
