This is Maxwell Kilman's repository for UP221 - Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science
## About Me 
Hello! My name is Maxwell Kilman (he/his) but I go by Max. I’m a first-year in the MURP-GLM program. I was drawn to UP221, in part, as I’m fascinated by experimental cartography and other visual representations of the historical and relational processes of city-making. In particular, I’m curious to learn more about the capacity of these media to help build public knowledge, sustain cooperative systems of living, and provide new forms of data to policymakers. I’ve been inspired by the work of Annette Kim and Juan De Lara. Anyway, that's enough about me. 
## Why UP 221? (+ some interests and objectives)
I have very little experience with both spatial data science and coding, so this course will require a lot of careful preparation on my part. I’m eager to get a better grasp of the technical practices of spatial analysis while also becoming more literate in urban data science such that I may more critically examine the immense library of existing research. I also feel excited to join you all in developing an original research project throughout the quarter. I’m curious to look at topics related to environmental health or CLTs. While I can’t say I have a specific research question in mind, I hope this course will help me in formulating the ‘right’ questions.
